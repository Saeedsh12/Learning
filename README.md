# My Learning 2020
  - I am sharing my active projects, recent publications, readings, and note + important links, courses, etc.  The current repository shows my activities for the second half of 2020!

# Active Projects
## Autonomous Driving
### Instantaneous Velocity Estimation - Automotive Radar
- Results of this research is published at:

  - Instantaneous Velocity Estimation for 360 â€¢ Perception with Multiple High-Quality Radars: An Experimental Validation Study [[Researchgate](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/342010637_Instantaneous_Velocity_Estimation_for_360_Perception_with_Multiple_High-Quality_Radars_An_Experimental_Validation_Study)]

### Using Deep Learning for Target to Track Association - Automotive Radar
- Implemented and writing in progress! Paper will be submitted in WCX 2021!
- Improve the association function to find the best target to represent a track with the help of the Instantaneous Velocity Estimation method! 
  
### Resume - Job description automatic analysis! 
- A product has been developed with the help of 4 recent graduated friends to help job seekers to evaluate their resume relative to a job description automatically. 
Important skills and features from resume and job description are extracted based on a designed NLP model and a score will be assigned which shows the chance of applicant to get an interview for the desired position! Some useful feedbacks are provided to help the applicant to improve his/ her resume!
The product will be available for free in September 2020!

  - Greedy Algorithms [[coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox/lecture/diKe3/review-of-greedy-algorithms)]
    - Note:   
      Greedy is an algorithmic paradigm that builds up a solution piece by piece, always choosing the next piece that offers the most obvious and immediate benefit. Greedy algorithms are used for optimization problems. An optimization problem can be solved using Greedy if the problem has the following property: At every step, we can make a choice that looks best at the moment, and we get the optimal solution of the complete problem.
  If a Greedy Algorithm can solve a problem, then it generally becomes the best method to solve that problem as the Greedy algorithms are in general more efficient than other techniques like Dynamic Programming. But Greedy algorithms cannot always be applied. For example, Fractional Knapsack problem (See this) can be solved using Greedy, but 0-1 Knapsack cannot be solved using Greedy.
